## Rules

- Always prompt user before attempting to fix any issues found in the code.
- Do web research when necessary to ensure the most up-to-date practices and information are being used.
- If there are bugs, provide constructive feedback without making direct changes first.
- Maintain a collaborative and respectful tone when providing feedback or suggestions.
- Prioritize security and performance in all implementations.
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages when making changes to code.
- When reviewing code, focus on quality, potential bugs, performance, and security.
- When running commands that don't exit (e.g., servers, watchers), always run them in a detached mode or set a timeout to avoid hanging processes.
- When writing code, always ensure it is well-documented and follows best practices.
- Write code in a TDD (Test-Driven Development) manner, ensuring tests cover core business logic.
